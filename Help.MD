Setting up Twilio involves creating a Twilio account, obtaining your Account SID and Auth Token, and configuring a Twilio phone number. Here are the steps to set up Twilio:


**Step 1: Create a Twilio Account**

Go to the Twilio website: https://www.twilio.com/.
Click the "Get started for free" button.
Follow the on-screen instructions to sign up for a Twilio account. You may need to verify your email address and phone number.

**Step 2: Obtain Your Account SID and Auth Token**

After you've created your Twilio account, you'll need to obtain your Account SID and Auth Token, which are used for authentication when making requests to the Twilio API.

Log in to your Twilio account using your credentials.
Once logged in, you'll be on the Twilio Console dashboard.
Your Account SID and Auth Token can be found on the dashboard's home screen.

**Step 3: Set Up a Twilio Phone Number**

To send SMS messages or make phone calls with Twilio, you'll need to configure a Twilio phone number.

In the Twilio Console, navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section.
Click the "Buy a Phone Number" button to purchase a new phone number or use an existing one if you have it.
Follow the on-screen instructions to select your phone number.

**Step 4: Configure Your Application**

In your Spring Boot application (or any application you're using), you'll need to configure the following information:

Account SID: This is your Twilio account's unique identifier.
Auth Token: This is the authentication token used to authenticate your API requests.
Twilio Phone Number: The Twilio phone number you obtained in Step 3.
You should store these values securely and never expose them in your code or publicly.

Here's how you can configure these values in a Spring Boot application using application.properties

In your Spring Boot application, you can access the following URLs:

Send OTP Form: This URL is used to initiate the OTP sending process by entering the user's phone number.


URL: http://localhost:8080/otp/send
Method: GET
Use this URL to access the OTP form where users can enter their phone number to receive an OTP via SMS.
Verify OTP: After entering the OTP received on their phone, users can use this URL to verify the OTP and complete the authentication.


URL: http://localhost:8080/otp/verify
Method: POST
Use this URL to submit the entered OTP for verification.
Success Page: This URL is displayed when the OTP verification is successful.


URL: http://localhost:8080/otp/success

Use this URL to display a success message to the user after successful OTP verification.
Failure Page: This URL is displayed when the OTP verification fails.


URL: http://localhost:8080/otp/failure
